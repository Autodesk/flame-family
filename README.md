# README

The flame-family repository contains Matchbox / Lightbox shaders, Pybox handlers and python files to be used with Flame, Flare, Flame Assist and Smoke. These adds-on are provided by both Autodesk employees and the users community.

The shaders folder contains GLSL shaders that can be used as plugins in Action, Batch, Batch FX, the Timeline and the Tools tab. You can download the desired shaders to the folder of your choice on your file system, which must be specified in Preferences > Shader Paths within the application.

The python folder contains python files and snippets that can be used in the python console or as custom actions.
